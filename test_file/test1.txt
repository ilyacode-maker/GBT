 The idiot by fyodor desteovsky 	 short, funny and simple
**The Imbecile (A Farce)**

Meet Prince Myshkin, a well-meaning but hopelessly clueless dude. He's like a walking disaster, accidentally saying the wrong 
thing at every turn.

Enter Rogozhin, a possessive brute with a jealous streak wider than the Grand Canyon. He's got a thing for Myshkin's fiancï¿½, 
Nastasya. Drama ensues when Myshkin accidentally proposes to Nastasya, thinking she's a maid.

Chaos reigns as Myshkin's idiocy leads him into hilarious misadventures, including getting his head stuck in a vase and setting 
his hotel room on fire. Meanwhile, Rogozhin's jealousy spirals out of control, resulting in a ridiculous chase scene that involves 
sword fights and a giant cake.

In the end, Myshkin's pure-hearted idiocy melts everyone's hearts, even Rogozhin's. But hey, who needs a happy ending when you can 
have a good laugh?
