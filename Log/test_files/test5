            Propmt : Give me a reformulation of the following story in the same number of words, you allowed a tolerance over
        the number of words equal to 5%

            The input text In a certain Eussian ministerial department
But it is perhaps better that I do not mention
which department it was. There are in the
whole of Eussia no persons more sensitive than
Government officials. Each of them believes if he is annoyed in any way, that the whole official class is 
insulted in his person.
Eecently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)—I do not know of which town—is said to have
drawn up a report with the object of showing
that, ignoring Government orders, people were
speaking of Isprawniks in terms of contempt. In
order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with
his report a bulky work of fiction, in which on
about every tenth page an Isprawnik appeared
generally in a drunken condition.
In order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness, I will not definitely indicate the department in which the scene 
of my story is laid, and
will rather say "
in a certain chancellery."
Well, in a certain chancellery there was a
certain man who, as I cannot deny, was not of an attractive appearance. He was short, had a face marke'd with 
smallpox, was rather bald infront, and his forehead and cheeks were deeplylined with furrows—to say nothing of 
otherphysical imperfections. Such was the outeraspect of our hero, as produced by the St Petersburg climate.
As regards his official rank—for with usEussians the official rank must always be given—he was what is usually 
known as a permanenttitular councillor, one of those unfortunate beingswho, as is well known, are made a butt of 
byvarious authors who have the Had habit ofattacking people who cannot defend themselves.Our hero's family name 
was Bashmatchkin; his baptismal name Akaki Akakievitch. Perhaps the reader may think this name somewhatstrange 
and far-fetched, but he can be assuredthat it is not so, and that circumstances soarranged it that it was quite 
impossible to givehim any other name.
This happened in the following way. AkakiAkakievitch was born, if I am not mistaken, onthe night of the 23rd of 
March. His deceasedmother, the wife of an official and a very goodwoman, immediately made proper arrangements 
for his baptism. When the time came,she was lying on the bed before the door. Ather right hand stood the 
godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch Jeroshkin, a very important person, whowas registrar of the senate ; at her left, 
the god-mother Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the
wife of a police inspector, a woman of rare
virtues.
Three names were suggested to the mother
from which to choose one for the child—Mokuja, Sossuja, or Khozdazat. " No," she said, "
I don't like such names."
In order to meet her wishes, the church calendar was opened in another place, and the names
Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.
' ' This is a punishment from heaven,
' said the
mother. "What sort of names are these! I never heard the like ! If it had been Varadat
or Varukh, but Triphiliy and Varakhasiy ! ' ' They looked again in the calendar and found
Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy.
"Now I see," said the mother, "this is plainly fate. If there is no help for it, then he
had better take his father's name, which was
Akaki."
So the child was called Akaki Akakievitch.
It was baptised, although it wept and cried and
made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a presentiment that it would one day be a titular
councillor.


            --------------------Reformulation----------------
            In an undisclosed governmental department, there worked an unassuming individual. His diminutive stature and pockmarked face, coupled with a receding hairline and furrowed features, hardly made him a paragon of beauty. To add to his peculiar appearance, the harsh climate of St. Petersburg had left its mark on his visage.

Officially designated as a titular councilor, he belonged to the oft-ridiculed echelon of minor bureaucrats. His name, Akaki Akakievitch Bashmatchkin, was an amusing quirk of fate. His unnamed mother, a pious woman, had faced a peculiar predicament at his baptism. The traditional names suggested by the church calendar proved distasteful to her. Fate, it seemed, had other plans. When the name Akaki, his father's name, appeared on the calendar, she took it as a sign and bestowed it upon her newborn son.

As an infant, Akaki's cries of protest at his baptism hinted at a life of bureaucratic drudgery ahead. His existence, marked by the indignities and petty annoyances of his low rank, had a profoundly dispiriting effect on his appearance. His threadbare uniform, faded by the relentless passage of time, mirrored the bleakness of his daily routine.

Despite his unassuming nature, Akaki harbored an unquenchable longing for a life beyond the confines of his dreary existence. A dream of acquiring a new overcoat, a garment that would shield him from the harsh elements and lend him a sense of dignity, consumed his thoughts. Little did he know that this seemingly trivial desire would set him on an unexpected and transformative journey.
