            Propmt : Give me a reformulation of the following story in the same number of words, you allowed a tolerance over
        the number of words equal to 5%

            The input text In a certain Eussian ministerial department
But it is perhaps better that I do not mention
which department it was. There are in the
whole of Eussia no persons more sensitive than
Government officials. Each of them believes if he is annoyed in any way, that the whole official class is 
insulted in his person.
Eecently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)—I do not know of which town—is said to have
drawn up a report with the object of showing
that, ignoring Government orders, people were
speaking of Isprawniks in terms of contempt. In
order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with
his report a bulky work of fiction, in which on
about every tenth page an Isprawnik appeared
generally in a drunken condition.
In order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness, I will not definitely indicate the department in which the scene 
of my story is laid, and
will rather say "
in a certain chancellery."
Well, in a certain chancellery there was a
certain man who, as I cannot deny, was not of an attractive appearance. He was short, had a face marke'd with 
smallpox, was rather bald infront, and his forehead and cheeks were deeplylined with furrows—to say nothing of 
otherphysical imperfections. Such was the outeraspect of our hero, as produced by the St Petersburg climate.
As regards his official rank—for with usEussians the official rank must always be given—he was what is usually 
known as a permanenttitular councillor, one of those unfortunate beingswho, as is well known, are made a butt of 
byvarious authors who have the Had habit ofattacking people who cannot defend themselves.Our hero's family name 
was Bashmatchkin; his baptismal name Akaki Akakievitch. Perhaps the reader may think this name somewhatstrange 
and far-fetched, but he can be assuredthat it is not so, and that circumstances soarranged it that it was quite 
impossible to givehim any other name.
This happened in the following way. AkakiAkakievitch was born, if I am not mistaken, onthe night of the 23rd of 
March. His deceasedmother, the wife of an official and a very goodwoman, immediately made proper arrangements 
for his baptism. When the time came,she was lying on the bed before the door. Ather right hand stood the 
godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch Jeroshkin, a very important person, whowas registrar of the senate ; at her left, 
the god-mother Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the
wife of a police inspector, a woman of rare
virtues.
Three names were suggested to the mother
from which to choose one for the child—Mokuja, Sossuja, or Khozdazat. " No," she said, "
I don't like such names."
In order to meet her wishes, the church calendar was opened in another place, and the names
Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.
' ' This is a punishment from heaven,
' said the
mother. "What sort of names are these! I never heard the like ! If it had been Varadat
or Varukh, but Triphiliy and Varakhasiy ! ' ' They looked again in the calendar and found
Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy.
"Now I see," said the mother, "this is plainly fate. If there is no help for it, then he
had better take his father's name, which was
Akaki."
So the child was called Akaki Akakievitch.
It was baptised, although it wept and cried and
made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a presentiment that it would one day be a titular
councillor.


            --------------------Reformulation----------------
            In a Russian government agency (to remain undisclosed for diplomatic reasons), a man of humble stature and pockmarked countenance toiled as Akaky Akakievich Bashmatchkin, a "permanent titular councillor." This rank made him a target of mockery, etched into his weather-beaten visage.

Akaky's birth had ordained his fate. On March 23rd, his mother had witnessed the arrival of her child and the presentation of three peculiar names: Mokuja, Sossuja, and Khozdazat, all rejected by her. Further searches yielded Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy, prompting despair. Finally, to avoid further torment, she chose Akaki, her husband's name.

Baptized amid wails and grimaces, Akaky seemed to sense his destiny as a lowly "titular councillor."
