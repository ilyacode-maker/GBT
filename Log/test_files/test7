            Propmt : Give me a reformulation of the following story in 50 words

            The input text In a certain Eussian ministerial department
But it is perhaps better that I do not mention
which department it was. There are in the
whole of Eussia no persons more sensitive than
Government officials. Each of them believes if he is annoyed in any way, that the whole official class is 
insulted in his person.
Eecently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)â€”I do not know of which townâ€”is said to have
drawn up a report with the object of showing
that, ignoring Government orders, people were
speaking of Isprawniks in terms of contempt. In
order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with
his report a bulky work of fiction, in which on
about every tenth page an Isprawnik appeared
generally in a drunken condition.
In order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness, I will not definitely indicate the department in which the scene 
of my story is laid, and
will rather say "
in a certain chancellery."
Well, in a certain chancellery there was a
certain man who, as I cannot deny, was not of an attractive appearance. He was short, had a face marke'd with 
smallpox, was rather bald infront, and his forehead and cheeks were deeplylined with furrowsâ€”to say nothing of 
otherphysical imperfections. Such was the outeraspect of our hero, as produced by the St Petersburg climate.
As regards his official rankâ€”for with usEussians the official rank must always be givenâ€”he was what is usually 
known as a permanenttitular councillor, one of those unfortunate beingswho, as is well known, are made a butt of 
byvarious authors who have the Had habit ofattacking people who cannot defend themselves.Our hero's family name 
was Bashmatchkin; his baptismal name Akaki Akakievitch. Perhaps the reader may think this name somewhatstrange 
and far-fetched, but he can be assuredthat it is not so, and that circumstances soarranged it that it was quite 
impossible to givehim any other name.
This happened in the following way. AkakiAkakievitch was born, if I am not mistaken, onthe night of the 23rd of 
March. His deceasedmother, the wife of an official and a very goodwoman, immediately made proper arrangements 
for his baptism. When the time came,she was lying on the bed before the door. Ather right hand stood the 
godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch Jeroshkin, a very important person, whowas registrar of the senate ; at her left, 
the god-mother Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the
wife of a police inspector, a woman of rare
virtues.
Three names were suggested to the mother
from which to choose one for the childâ€”Mokuja, Sossuja, or Khozdazat. " No," she said, "
I don't like such names."
In order to meet her wishes, the church calendar was opened in another place, and the names
Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.
' ' This is a punishment from heaven,
' said the
mother. "What sort of names are these! I never heard the like ! If it had been Varadat
or Varukh, but Triphiliy and Varakhasiy ! ' ' They looked again in the calendar and found
Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy.
"Now I see," said the mother, "this is plainly fate. If there is no help for it, then he
had better take his father's name, which was
Akaki."
So the child was called Akaki Akakievitch.
It was baptised, although it wept and cried and
made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a presentiment that it would one day be a titular
councillor.


            --------------------Reformulation----------------
            In the labyrinthine bureaucracy of an unnamed Russian department, a tale unfolds. Among the multitude of government employees, one peculiar individual emerges—Akaki Akakievitch Bashmatchkin.

Bashmatchkin, a titular councillor, was a man of unassuming appearance. His diminutive stature, scarred visage, and prematurely aged countenance painted an unflattering portrait. Yet, despite his homely exterior, his official rank held significance in the Russian societal hierarchy.

His unusual name, Akaki, was bestowed upon him by fate. As his mother lay in her bed, three peculiar choices were presented for his baptism: Mokuja, Sossuja, and Khozdazat. Undeterred, the church calendar was consulted anew, yielding equally eccentric options.

Resigned to her destiny, Bashmatchkin's mother decided to name him after his father, Akaki. Thus, the titular councillor carried the whimsical legacy of his paternal ancestry.

From his birth, an ominous cry seemed to foreshadow his future existence. As an infant, Bashmatchkin squirmed and protested, as if aware of the bureaucratic purgatory that awaited him.

As Bashmatchkin navigated the complexities of official life, his unassuming demeanor often invited the ridicule of his superiors. However, amidst the mockery and scorn, a glimmer of sympathy occasionally emerged, acknowledging the inherent dignity beneath his unprepossessing exterior.
