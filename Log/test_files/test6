            Propmt : Give me a reformulation of the following story in 50 words

            The input text In a certain Eussian ministerial department
But it is perhaps better that I do not mention
which department it was. There are in the
whole of Eussia no persons more sensitive than
Government officials. Each of them believes if he is annoyed in any way, that the whole official class is 
insulted in his person.
Eecently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)â€”I do not know of which townâ€”is said to have
drawn up a report with the object of showing
that, ignoring Government orders, people were
speaking of Isprawniks in terms of contempt. In
order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with
his report a bulky work of fiction, in which on
about every tenth page an Isprawnik appeared
generally in a drunken condition.
In order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness, I will not definitely indicate the department in which the scene 
of my story is laid, and
will rather say "
in a certain chancellery."
Well, in a certain chancellery there was a
certain man who, as I cannot deny, was not of an attractive appearance. He was short, had a face marke'd with 
smallpox, was rather bald infront, and his forehead and cheeks were deeplylined with furrowsâ€”to say nothing of 
otherphysical imperfections. Such was the outeraspect of our hero, as produced by the St Petersburg climate.
As regards his official rankâ€”for with usEussians the official rank must always be givenâ€”he was what is usually 
known as a permanenttitular councillor, one of those unfortunate beingswho, as is well known, are made a butt of 
byvarious authors who have the Had habit ofattacking people who cannot defend themselves.Our hero's family name 
was Bashmatchkin; his baptismal name Akaki Akakievitch. Perhaps the reader may think this name somewhatstrange 
and far-fetched, but he can be assuredthat it is not so, and that circumstances soarranged it that it was quite 
impossible to givehim any other name.
This happened in the following way. AkakiAkakievitch was born, if I am not mistaken, onthe night of the 23rd of 
March. His deceasedmother, the wife of an official and a very goodwoman, immediately made proper arrangements 
for his baptism. When the time came,she was lying on the bed before the door. Ather right hand stood the 
godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch Jeroshkin, a very important person, whowas registrar of the senate ; at her left, 
the god-mother Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the
wife of a police inspector, a woman of rare
virtues.
Three names were suggested to the mother
from which to choose one for the childâ€”Mokuja, Sossuja, or Khozdazat. " No," she said, "
I don't like such names."
In order to meet her wishes, the church calendar was opened in another place, and the names
Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.
' ' This is a punishment from heaven,
' said the
mother. "What sort of names are these! I never heard the like ! If it had been Varadat
or Varukh, but Triphiliy and Varakhasiy ! ' ' They looked again in the calendar and found
Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy.
"Now I see," said the mother, "this is plainly fate. If there is no help for it, then he
had better take his father's name, which was
Akaki."
So the child was called Akaki Akakievitch.
It was baptised, although it wept and cried and
made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a presentiment that it would one day be a titular
councillor.


            --------------------Reformulation----------------
            In the labyrinthine bureaucratic world of Russia, where government officials tread with an air of supreme sensitivity, a curious tale unfolds in an unnamed department. Within this enigmatic chancellery, resided a man of unprepossessing stature. Beset by the ravages of smallpox, his face bore the marks of time and hardship. His pate, partially devoid of hair, and his countenance, creased with myriad furrows, hinted at the harsh realities of life in the imperial capital of St. Petersburg.

As to his bureaucratic status, this individual held the unenviable position of a permanent titular councillor. Such ill-starred beings, the targets of literary derision, found themselves the perpetual objects of ridicule. The man's surname was Bashmatchkin, and his baptismal name, Akaki Akakievitch—a peculiar moniker, albeit one borne out of necessity.

Legend has it that on the fateful night of March 23rd, Akaki Akakievitch was born. His departed mother, a woman of devout faith, promptly arranged for his christening. As she lay in her sickbed, flanked on one side by the esteemed registrar of the senate, Ivan Ivanovitch Jeroshkin, and on the other by the virtuous Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, wife of a police inspector, three potential names were proffered for the newborn's consideration: Mokuja, Sossuja, and Khozdazat.

However, these names met with the mother's disapproval. Consulting the church calendar, the search continued, yielding such uninspiring options as Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy. Resolving to accept her fate, the mother turned to her husband's name, Akaki, and thus, Akaki Akakievitch came into being.

As the infant was baptized, it voiced its displeasure with cries and grimaces, as if sensing the uninspiring destiny that lay ahead—a life as a lowly titular councillor in the vast and impersonal halls of the Russian bureaucracy.
